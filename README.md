This is a student management system that enables teachers to perform 5 operations: Add Student, Remove Student, Retrieve Student's Data, Update Student's Data, and Display all Student's Data. Students can only perform 1 operation, which is to display their own records. The system stores the following information about each student: 
1) Student ID 
2) Student's first and last name 
3) Student gender 
4) Academic year 
5) GPA.

For teachers:
To add a student, the system requires the following 5 fields:
1) Student ID: This is a unique 7-digit number. You cannot enter the same ID as an existing student.
2) First and last name: Must contain letters only.
3) Student Gender: The user must enter 'M' (for Male) or 'F' (for Female).
4) Academic Year: The student's academic year is between year 1 and year 5.
5) GPA: The GPA must be a positive floating number between 0.0 and 4.0.

To remove a student, update a student's data, or retrieve a student's data, you'll need to provide the ID of the student that you want to modify, remove, or retrieve from the system.

For students, the system will ask for their ID, which must be entered by the teacher first before the student can display their own records.
